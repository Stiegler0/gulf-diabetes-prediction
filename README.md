# Gulf Diabetes Prediction
## Overview
This project is the culmination of my Bachelor's internship at [the Computer Science Department of the Higher School of Technology in Oujda, Morocco](http://esto.ump.ma/). It focuses on the analysis of medical datasets and the development of machine learning models to predict diabetes in Gulf countries. This work was carried out in collaboration with my colleague, [Ziad Lyagoubi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ziad-lyagoubi-04b5381bb), blending academic learning with practical application in data science and health informatics.I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to our project mentor and professor, [Mohamed BADAOUI,](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Badaoui-Mohammed), whose guidance and expertise were invaluable to the success of this project.

## Installation and Usage

## follow specific instructions to run the project


## Data

The dataset used in this project includes various medical attributes relevant to diabetes. It is located in the `datasets/` directory.
## Power BI Dashboard
//I will deploy soon either the dashboard and the models online
To visualize the insights and analytics from our data, we have created an interactive Power BI dashboard. You can view the dashboard [here](link-to-dashboard). For a local view, please download the `DashboardProjet.pbix` file from the `dashboard-PowerBI/` directory and open it with Power BI Desktop.



## Acknowledgments
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Computer Science Department at the Higher School of Technology, Oujda, Morocco, for the resources and opportunity provided for this research. Special thanks to our mentor, Mr. Badaoui Mohamed, for his invaluable support and guidance. My appreciation also extends to my project partner, Ziad Lyagoubi, whose dedication and collaborative spirit were vital to the success of this project.
